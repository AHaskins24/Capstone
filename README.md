# Data Analytics Project README

Objective

This data analytics capstone proposal aims to investigate the relationship between stress and consumer behavior by analyzing data on mental health, pulse spending, and Census records related to COVID-19. The study recognizes that stress can significantly impact individuals' decision-making processes and purchasing habits, particularly in the aftermath of COVID-19. Understanding this influence is crucial for businesses seeking to tailor their marketing strategies and product offerings effectively. The project will leverage various data analysis tools, including Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI to analyze and visualize the collected data. Python will be used to manage and query the databases containing the mental health and consumer spending data, allowing for efficient data retrieval and aggregationas well as employed for data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and the exploration of relationships between variables, as well as visuals. Power BI  will serve as visualization platforms to create an interactive dashboard and reports, enabling the effective communication of findings and insights derived from the data. 

Data

The following datasets will be used for this project:

- "NEA-AU22-Pandemic-Response-Monthly-PI.xlsx"

Timeline

- **Data collection:** Obtain the necessary datasets on consumer spending patterns, preferably with a breakdown by product categories or industries. (Deadline: 5/15/23)
- **Data preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the datasets to ensure consistency and compatibility. Handle missing values, format inconsistencies, and harmonize the data from different sources. (Deadline: 6/10/23)
- **Timeframe selection:** Choose a suitable timeframe for analysis, comparing consumer spending patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., from 2020 to 2021) with previous years (e.g., 2018 to 2019). (Deadline: 6/10/23)
- **Analyzing overall spending trends:** Calculate and visualize the total consumer spending for each period under consideration. Compare the overall spending levels and identify any significant changes or trends. (Deadline: 6/17/23)
- **Identifying shifts in spending patterns:** Explore specific product categories or industries within the datasets. Calculate the spending for each category and compare the proportions and changes over time. Identify notable shifts, such as increased or decreased spending on certain products or industries during the pandemic compared to previous years. (Deadline: 6/17/23)
- **Visualization and reporting:** Create clear and informative visualizations, such as line graphs, bar charts, or heatmaps, to present the findings effectively. Generate a concise report summarizing the key insights, highlighting any significant changes in spending patterns. (Deadline: 6/17/23)
- **Internal Demos:** Present your analysis and progress internally. (Deadline: 6/22/23)
- **Demo Day!:** Final presentation and demonstration of the project. (Deadline: 6/29/23)

Conclusion

This data analytics project aims to provide actionable insights for businesses, contributing to more effective strategies for supporting communities in the aftermath of Covid. By analyzing the relationship between stress and consumer buying behavior, we can better understand the impacts of COVID-19 and other stressors on consumer spending patterns.
